### Zigbee network
  
Since my Home Assistant server is colocated, I needed a Zigbee Coordinator that is ethernet connected, I dont want Zigbee over Wi-Fi.  
The Silvercrest Smart Home Gateway matched my requirements, and there is a great guide for getting it flashed for use in Home Assistant.

There are others out there, also some that is PoE powerd, but the Silvercrest Smart Home Gateway is working just fine.
