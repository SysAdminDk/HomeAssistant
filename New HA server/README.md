### Home Assistant Server

After some network issues, I have decided to have my Home Assistant server running locally, moving it away from the server I have hosted elsewhere.
Latency hasn‚Äôt been an issue, but if there is no internet, then the automation will stop working, and I don‚Äôt want to have a backup internet connection when it is only the HA server that needs to be moved home.

I have been looking for various options, including making the changes to my Dream Machine SE, to allow HA to run in a Docker, but the previous times I have tried that, something will break when updates are done on the UDM.
The latest version of this option can be found here.

There are also lots of the ‚Äú1L‚Äù machines that are a good option for running Home Assistant, and a rackmount kit is also possible. An i3 with 8Gb and some SSD space are sufficient.

Also, lots of posts around using the new N100-based machines, there is more than enough power, but they are quite expensive, and I cannot find any rack-mount kits, other than just putting them on a shelf in the rack. (Not rack-mount in my book)

I found an older post on ServerBuilds.net where they are using older network/email/firewall/security Appliances to run pfSense or ONSense, which got me thinking üòä and doing some eBay searching I ended up ordering a Pulse Secure PSA3000.

### The PSA3000 is just what I needed for Home Assistant.

The PSA3000 is based on the Intel Celeron J1900 with 8 GB of memory, with room for a couple of SSD disks for data storage.
